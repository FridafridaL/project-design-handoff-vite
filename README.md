# Design Handoff Project

This is a colaboration project with UX-design students. We were paired up and as a web dev student i should transform the design student design into code. the page is translated into three languages.

## Getting Started with the Project

We started the project with a design hand-off, going through the design.
I the did a ruf plan of what I thoght i needed code-wise.

### The Problem

I started by building sections and components. Tried to use as much reusable components as i could. I've also used third-party-library for the swiper and i18next for language translation.
